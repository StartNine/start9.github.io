title: It Is Now Safe to Turn Off Your Computer

Hello. Unfortunately, we’ve realized that we’re going to have to leave Start9 
behind for the foreseeable future, so we can focus on university, work, life, 
and other things more within reach. It might be hard for us to work on Start9 with 
all these commitments in place, if not impossible, though we may still work on it 
intermittently, should we find both the time and residual willpower. Consider Start9 
effectively vaporized if our GitHub has no activity in 3 years from now, and 
don’t expect a release even before then. Start9.UI.Wpf and other such prerequisites 
may still see activity due to their use outside of Start9, but this alone should 
not be taken as an indication of activity for the project as a whole.


We’ve made some progress since the last blog post, though, in the time it has 
taken us to come to this decision. The most obvious one is Shale, which was to 
be our new flagship design language. We’ve tried to make Shale a balance between 
the flat designs of the now and the depth of skeuomorphic design of the recent 
past, with a fair deal of success. We had planned to use it across Start9 to 
provide a consistent default look. In the meantime, Shale may well pop up 
elsewhere, but we won’t make any promises. File Commander has also made 
significant progress, though it still has quite a long journey ahead yet, and 
likely won’t see much further development anytime soon.


Furthermore, reflectronic had created, and later lost, a small amount of code 
for the new  pipeline for `start9-api`, which was to be based on 
[Orleans](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans). The progress made originally was 
only preliminary experimentation anyway, and didn’t yet do anything useful. 
Either way, so this alone isn’t all that much of a setback for the project.


For those wondering, we’ll be leaving the Start9 website and Discord server up - 
though inactive - for those interested. To ensure people don’t waste their time 
searching for a Start9 binary which doesn’t exist, we’ll leave this blog post up 
until there’s nobody else left to see it. If for some reason you would like to 
download this page, it is available 
[here](https://github.com/startnine/start9.menu/blob/gh-pages/final-blog.html).


Despite this, we’d still like to apologise for taking so painfully long to 
provide any results. While these blog posts are written by the core dev team 
collectively, a few members of the team would like to say some parting words 
individually:

> I would like to apologize for my failure to manage expectations - I ignored my 
> better judgement and, in a rather uncharacteristic move, made a promise I could 
> never have hoped to keep. Blinded by the incredible vision we had, I wrongly 
> believed we had nowhere to go but up, thus leading me to disregard my normal fear 
> of making promises I can’t keep and do exactly that. But none of the circumstances 
> justify my error. This was wrong of me, and I’m not afraid to admit it. I knew 
> better than to make such a promise, and should never have ignored my better 
> judgement. I’m sorry, to all of you, for all of this. I wish you all the best.

i don't want to put this in the blog post (i didn't do anything in regards
to the C# side of the project) - but i want to say that i hope we can get back 
together again and do something once more. it was fun while we had it in us. i 
*really* appreciate everyone that followed Start9 and talked to us about it,
and i wish y'all well for your next endeavors

Among many other things, whether this is the end of Start9 remains unclear, but 
one thing isn’t ambiguous at all: Windows customization as a whole will live on 
no matter what. We trust in every one of you reading this to ensure that much. 
You hold the power to make that happen, not just us. Keep making these things 
your own by whatever means necessary. As long as you do, the dream will live on. 
Until our return, if anyone wants to take up the Start9 torch and build upon our 
work, you have our full blessing, and we wish you all the best and then some.


Best wishes to all of you.


Sincerely,
@reflectronic, @splitwirez, @logonoff


p.s. In the event that progress resumes, we’ll make sure it’s known, but not 
until we can confidently say that success is within reach. We won’t be repeating 
the mistake we made here, that’s for sure. Don’t hold your breath though - it may 
well never happen, and if it ever does, expect it to be quite a while away yet. 
We’re sorry we’ve kept you waiting so long for nothing :(
