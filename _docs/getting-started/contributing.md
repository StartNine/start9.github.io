### Security Issue 
**Do not report the issue using GitHub**
You can use GitHub to submit bugs and error reports. Please note that if you found a security issue, email us at [start9@outlook.com](mailto:start9@outlook.com). For more information, including our PGP keys, refer to [our page on where to disclose security issues and bugs](https://github.com/startnine/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

### Non-security related issues
1. Please check if the issue has been already posted on the issues page 
2. Include the exact version of Start9 you are using 
3. Use a clear title and description 
4. Add steps on how to reproduce your issue 
5. Add the "bug" label 

## Submitting a suggestion 
The easiest way to have your suggestion implemented into Start9 quickly is for you or someone else write code and create a pull request. However, you may also suggest ideas using GitHub issues tracking, although it may take much longer for a feature to be added. See "[Writing Code](#writing-code)."
1. Include a clear title and description of what you want in Start9
2. Add concepts or mockups if needed
3. Add the "suggestion" label

## Writing Code
